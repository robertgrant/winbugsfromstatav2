# winbugsfromstatav2
The experimental v2 versions of John Thompson's winbugsfromstata package of commands, including JAGS compatibility

These files are intended for use alongside the existing files, which can be obtained thus:

```
net from http://www.stata-press.com/data/bas
net get bayes
do bayes
```

Then, follow the instructions in the readme.txt file to complete installation. You will need the WinBUGS folder location, so that should have been installed first.

These files are the sole work of Professor John Thompson of the University of Leicester. Licensing is his decision alone; provision of the files here is purely for convenience of the Stata community, and does not imply any warranty or license; use is entirely at your own risk.
